	<div id="02" style="margin-left:200px"><h4>SKELETON</h4></div>

	<div style="margin-left:200px"><p>Although complete dragon skeletons are hard to come by, most scholars agree that a little more than 500 bones comprise a dragon’s skeleton, compared to slightly more than 200 bones in a human skeleton. The bones in a dragon’s wings and spine account for most of the difference. Dragon bones are immensely strong, yet exceptionally light. In cross-section they look hollow, with thick walls made up of concentric circles of small chambers staggered like brickwork. Layers of sturdy connective tissue and blood vessels run between the layers. The accompanying diagram shows a dragon skeleton in detail. Significant parts of the skeleton are briefly discussed below. </p></div>

	<div style="margin-left:200px"><p>The keel, or sternum, serves as an anchor for the dragon’s flight muscles. The scapula draconis supports the wing. The metacarpis draconis and alar phalanges in each wing support most of the wing’s flight surface. In some dragons, the ulna draconic has an extension called the alar olecranon that lends extra support to the wing. The thirteenth cervical vertebra marks the base of a dragon’s neck. Every true dragon, no matter how large or small, has exactly 13 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, 7 lumbar vertebrae, and 36 caudal vertebrae.</p></div>

	<div id="03" style="margin-left:200px"><h4>MAJOR INTERNAL ORGANS</h4></div>
	<div style="margin-left:200px"><p>The insides of a dragon have several noteworthy features, all of which contribute to the dragon’s unique capabilities. A dragon’s eyes are slightly larger than they appear from the outside. The bulk of the eye remains buried inside the skull, with only a small portion of the whole exposed when a dragon opens its eyes. The eye’s extra size helps improve the dragon’s ability to see at a distance. The eye’s spherical shape allows the dragon to move the eye through a wide arc, helping to expand its field of vision. A dragon’s brain is exceptionally large, even for such a big creature, and it continues to grow as the dragon grows.It has highly developed sensory centers with specialized lobes that connect directly to the eyes, ears, and nasal passages. The brain also has large areas dedicated to memory and reasoning. </p></div>

	<div style="margin-left:200px"><p>The larynx contains numerous well-developed vocal folds that give a dragon tremendous control over the tone and pitch of its voice. A dragon’s voice can be as shrill as a crow’s or as deep as a giant’s. Some scholars, noting that the Draconic language contains many harsh sounds and sibilants, conclude that a dragon’s vocal capacity is limited, but this is not so. Dragons speak a strident language because it suits them to do so. The trachea connects the larynx to the lungs. It is the dragon’s conduit for respiration and also for its breath weapon. A dragon’s vast lungs fill much of its chest cavity. The lung structure resembles that of an avian, which can extract oxygen both on inhalation and exhalation. In addition to being the organs for respiration, a dragon’s breath weapon is generated in its lungs from secretions produced by the draconis fundamentum.</p></div> 

	<div style="margin-left:200px"><p>A dragon’s mighty heart has four chambers, just like a mammal’s heart. The draconis fundamentum is a gland possessed only by true dragons. Attached to the heart, it is the center of elemental activity inside the dragon’s body. All blood flowing from the heart passes through this organ before going to the body. The draconis fundamentum charges the lungs with power for a dragon’s breath weapon and also plays a major role in the dragon’s highly efficient the vast majority of whatever the creature consumes into usable energy. Blood vessels, nerves, and ducts run directly from the draconis fundamentum to the dragon’s flight muscles, charging them with enormous energy, and also to the lungs and the gizzard. A dragon digests its food through a combination of powerful muscular action and elemental force. The interior of the gizzard is lined with bony plates that grind up chunks of food, and the entire organ is charged with the same elemental energy that the dragon uses for its breath weapon.</p></div>

	<div id="04" style="margin-left:200px"><h4>MUSCULATURE</h4></div>
	<div style="margin-left:200px"><p>Intact dragon carcasses are even more rare than intact dragon skeletons, making any catalog of a dragon’s muscles unreliable at best. Given the number of bones in a dragon skeleton, however, a dragon’s muscles must number in the thousands. Overall, a dragon’s musculature resembles that of a great cat, but with much larger muscles in the chest, neck, and tail. The illustration on page 10 identifies the major muscle groups in a dragon’s body. Of most interest to scholars are the muscles involved in flight. These muscles can exert tremendous force and consume equally tremendous amounts of energy (which the draconis fundamentum supplies). The flight muscles are located in the chest and in the wings themselves. The alar pectoral is the main flight muscle and is used on the wing’s downstroke. The alar lattisimus dorsai draws the wing up and back. The alar deltoid and alar cleidomastoid draw the wings up and forward. The muscles of the wings serve mainly to control the wing’s shape, which in turn helps the dragon maneuver in the air. The alar tricep and alar bicep fold and unfold the wings. The alar carpi ulnaris and alar carpi radialus allow the wings to warp and twist.</p></div>
